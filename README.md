# About Me

Hey there! I'm a developer who's all about crafting sleek, user-friendly interfaces for mobile and web platforms using React, React Native, and TypeScript. With a knack for full-stack projects, I'm particularly jazzed about diving into front-end development. Plus, I'm a perpetual learner, always itching to explore new horizons!

# My Goals for 2024
* React (Native) seniority
* TypeScript mastery
