# About Me

Hey there! I’m a developer who’s all about crafting sleek, user-friendly interfaces for mobile and web platforms using React, React Native, and TypeScript. I also dive into full-stack development with Python and Django, bringing ideas to life from front to back. While front-end work still gets me the most fired up, I love tackling full-stack projects that challenge me end-to-end. Plus, I’m a perpetual learner, always itching to explore new horizons!
